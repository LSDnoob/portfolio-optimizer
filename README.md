# ortfolio Optimization Using the Efficient Frontier

## Overview

This project implements Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization to construct an optimal portfolio using historical stock data. The goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk by leveraging Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and visualizing the Efficient Frontier.

Key Features

- Fetches historical stock data using yfinance
- Computes daily returns, mean returns, and covariance matrix
- Uses Scipy's SLSQP optimizer for portfolio optimization
- Visualizes the Efficient Frontier
- Analyzes optimal portfolio weights for different target returns
